Krita is a professional FREE and open source painting program.

## Python scripting
Python is a scripting language, that can be used to automate tasks. What python scripting in Krita means is that we added an API to krita, which is a bit of programming that allows python to access to parts of Krita. With this we can make dockers, perform menial tasks on a lot of different files and even write our own exporters. People who work with computer graphics, like VFX and video game artists use python a lot to make things like sprite sheets, automate parts of export and more.
